Wagerr uses its native token, $WGR, for all betting activities:
- **Burning Mechanism:** Losing bets burn tokens, creating a deflationary supply model.
- **Oracle Rewards:** Oracle Masternodes earn a share of fees from winning bets.
- **Value Coupling:** Increased betting activity drives demand for $WGR, boosting its value.
